Using Deep reinforcement learning it is possible to train a AI to play the Cart pole game and get a perfect score consistently

Program Libary Requirements:
Tensorflow
Matplotlib
Keras
OpenAI Gym
numpy
Python 3.6+

How To Run The Different Programs (Must be in the directory of the programs): 

-randomActions.py:
  -In the cmd prompt enter python randomActions.py
  -Will show you what the cart would do with out training.

-cartPoleTrain.py:
  -In the cmd prompt enter python cartPoleTrain.py
  -Will show you the agent learning to play the game over 500 episodes(games) trying to achieve a score of 200

-cartPoleTrained.py:
  -newModel5.h5 must be in the same directory of this program
  -In the cmd prompt enter python cartPoleTrained.py
  -Will show you how a already trained model preforms over 100 episodes(games) trying to achieve a score of 200
